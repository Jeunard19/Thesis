# Languages Game VR

We created a Virtual Reality game using [Networked-Aframe]: https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe, where pairs can play charades in VR space.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. While in the project folder, Run ```npm i```
3. Run ```npm start```

### VR Game
The VR game runs on the localhost of a local laptop and can be made accessible to the headsets using [Telebit]:https://telebit.cloud, a net server that uses a relay to allow multiplexed incoming connections on any external port. The headsets could access the local host from their browsers using Telebit
